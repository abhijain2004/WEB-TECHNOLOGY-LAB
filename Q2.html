        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.
            It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft
            at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and
            have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride
            consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt
            together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although
            some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically
            do not actively seek out and prey on humans..</p>
